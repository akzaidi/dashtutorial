## Shiny Dashboard Tutorial

This package makes it easy to install all the dependencies you'll need for the Shiny Dashboard tutorial. It also contains all exercises and slides.

```r
devtools::install_github("jcheng5/dashtutorial")
```

Once successfully installed, you can copy the slides and exercises to the current directory with:

```r
dashtutorial::summon()
```

This will create a `dashtutorial` subdirectory in the current directory.
